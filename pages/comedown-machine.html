comedown machine

critical score - 7.5/10

personal score - 10/10



Comedown Machine is mature, contemplative. Throughout the album, an older Julian sings about feeling more and more out of place as he ages out of the glamor of the rock star lifestyle, but struggling to set down his dreams and settle down, ultimately begging others to decide for him. The Strokesâ€™ signature sound with the addictive hooks and genius licks can still be heard, but this time, bittersweet.



Lined with impeccable guitar work and striking melodies, Tap Out starts with Julian singing about a brief moment of connection during a one night stand, leaving him drifting, directionless.



All the Time finds Julian wanting to slow down. A reoccurring theme in the Strokes' discography is waiting and it is no different here
